## Points to keep in mimd

Because of how "preseed.cfg" is configured, the automatic installation will remove any lvm and raid volumes you have on your system. Before running an installation, please consider which information you want to keep on your system.

## Creadentials to acces the system once installed

- Root Password - root

- User - debian
- Password - debian

**I highly suggest changing the passwords and, if possible, even creating another user account and deleting the default one to evade ungranted access to your system. You've been advised.**
